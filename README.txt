Hello!

Thanks for checking out my repo! Here you will find a few examples of some of the code that I
have worked on for past projects while getting my degree. My hope is that these examples will
give you a better idea of the quality of my code as well as my coding style to help you decide
if I will be a good fit for your organization.

If you have any further questions please feel free to contact me using any of the methods
included in my resume!

Thanks for your time and interest,
Thomas
